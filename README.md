# Tetris
![tetris game](./img/tetris_game.PNG)
*Created in 2017*<br>
A clone of the puzzle game created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984.<br>
The project is web based and written in `javascript` and `html`.<br>
It uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for the game objects and the game rendering. <br>
For `html` manipulation it uses the [jquery](https://jquery.com/) library.

# How to run
You simply open the [index.html](./index.html) file in your browser.
Or you run a simple http server in the root folder with the command `npm start`.<br>
If you run the web server it will keep the high scores in a scores.txt file.

# Controls
`arrow up` rotate the piece.<br>
`arrow down` move the piece.<br>
`arrow left/right` move the piece to the left/right.<br>
`space bar` let the piece fall down.<br>
`h` toggle aid by seeing where the piece is going to fall.<br>
`a` toggle AI, if enabled the computer will play for you.<br>
`p` pause the game
